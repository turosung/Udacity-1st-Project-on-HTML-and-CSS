			<p class="text_align">This animal is referred to as a slow loris because it is an extremely slow moving arboreal creature.<br>
			  Slow lorises are nocturnal; during the day they sleep rolled up in a ball,<br> 
			  then at night they search for food.<br>
			  They are located in southeastern Asia, across India and the Philippines. <br>
			  They have opposable thumbs. These thumbs (on all four legs) help them grip branches.<br>
			  Their muscles allow them to remain still for long hours at a time <br>
